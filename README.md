Introduction
----

Bang is an OS X app for file sharing, like [droplr](https://droplr.com/). Since it uses the [Parse](https://parse.com/) for backend, you don't need to set up any server for running this app. 


### Features
* Share File (< 10M currently)
* Share Screenshot
* Share Text From Pasteboard
* Edit Text and Share

Set Up
----
* Go to [Parse](https://parse.com/) and create an app.
* Get the Application ID and Client Key and use them in AppDelegate.m

		//#define kParseApplicationId @"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID"
		//#define kParseClientKey	 @"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"

* Build and Run
