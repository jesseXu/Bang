Bang is an OS X app for file sharing, like [droplr](https://droplr.com/). Since it uses the [Parse](https://parse.com/) for backend, you don't need to set up any server for running this app. 

Have a try, download [here](http://y-d.me/Resource/Bang.zip)

Set Up

* Go to [Parse](https://parse.com/) and create an app.
* Get the Application ID and Client Key and use them in AppDelegate.m

		//#define kParseClientKey     @"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"

* Build and Run


TODO
